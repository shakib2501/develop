   The {@code StdIn} class provides static methods for reading strings
   and numbers from standard input.
   These functions fall into one of four categories:
   <ul>
   <li>those for reading individual tokens from standard input, one at a time,
       and converting each to a number, string, or boolean
   <li>those for reading characters from standard input, one at a time
   <li>those for reading lines from standard input, one at a time
   <li>those for reading a sequence of values of the same type from standard input,
       and returning the values in an array
   </ul>
   <p>
   Generally, it is best not to mix functions from the different
   categories in the same program.
